# Disclawd
What is Disclawd?  **Disclawd** is a clicker game for Discord. It's possible to "mine" blocks and ores from a pretty [familiar game](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us), doing this grants gold, xp and allows one to buy items. Besides that watch out to slay spawning monsters!

>[!NOTE]
> The bot is **guild-aware**, each server that interacts with a block creates its own world instance. This ensures server-specific block progress and mob spawning. (*Note: Instances are automatically cleared after 2 hours of inactivity*).
